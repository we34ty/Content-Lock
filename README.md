# Content-Lock
An extensive Minecraft datapack, focusing on progression and combat, which includes multiple new structures and mechanics for the game, introducing a whole new layer of complexity. This datapack was mainly inspired by games such as Dark Souls series as well as terraria.

The project is still in development, so any improvement ideas and bugs should be reported.

Downloading:
The datapack was made on 1.21.4 and recently ported to 1.21.11, so it's strongly recommended to play on this version of the game.
Place the main folder inside both your datapacks folder, in your save, and in the resource pack folder.
For the terrain generation to function properly it's recommended to "regenerate" chosen world, unless you create the world with the datapack enabled.
For any additional settings you can use "/function content_lock:options".
